## App Builder Building custom applications basics - courseware

App Builder is built to tie Adobe products together but we as trainers will have no idea what products the students will be entitled to use or what the enterprise owns.   Even if the enterprise has licenses for a product that does not necessarily mean that product is set up to be used for "Training use" or that the student has permissions to use that application and its API's.  To mitigate these risks we need a story that does not require Adobe product entitlement but will demonstrate core App Builder principles.

We needed a cohesive story to tell across all the training modules so the students will be able to relate learned concepts and see how they work together in a functional system.  For example, when they do work in the Actions Basics Course they will be building the services in the Frontend Building Basics course. 

This application follows and builds on the theme of our Digital Marketing Summit 2021 sneak "LiveWired".  The students will be building a form to request creative work to be done.  The training course videos that use this code can be found on Adobe Digital University. 

This application contains the following learning examples 
- **Collecting data** : How to build a form to collect data to be saved as a request for work
- **Storing data** : Storing the creative brief request form data
- **Throwing custom events** : Submitting a new request will throw a custom event for secondary systems to handle
- **Retrieving and displaying data** : List requests page where the user could find a list of briefs sitting in the system ready to be worked on.
- **Calling and presenting data from an Adobe API** : Students will build into the application a image search and select form that is powered by Adobe Stock.
